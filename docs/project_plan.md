# Twinsk Parcel - Enhanced Project Plan (English Version)

## 1. Project Overview

**Twinsk Parcel** is a comprehensive solution for receiving and billing parcels, designed to facilitate the tracking and management of shipments from our agency to various destinations including **Gabon**, **Togo**, **C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire**, **France**, and **Dubai**. The application relies on **Supabase** for real-time data handling (parcels, clients, rates, countries, disputes, employees).

The platform includes:
- A **dashboard** displaying key parcel statistics.
- A **parcel management** module (creation, tracking, billing, disputes).
- A **client management** module.
- An **invoicing** module for generating and downloading invoices in PDF format.
- A **statistics** module for monthly and country-based performance tracking.
- A **settings** module for configuring country-based rates, roles, permissions, language preferences (French, English, Chinese), and employee management.
- A **notification system** (WhatsApp and in-app) triggered by specific parcel status changes.

This solution automates the process of receiving, tracking, and billing parcels, while centralizing all data in a single database.
